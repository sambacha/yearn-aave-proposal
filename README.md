# YFI as a non-loanable collateral

## Disabled Depositing reduces risk

Currencies only enabled for depositing and borrowing (not usable as collaterals) present lower risk for the protocol. Collaterals are the assets of the protocol.

To remain solvent, these assets must remain greater than the liabilities, the loans. Currencies which can only be used for borrowing should always be excessively backed by other currencies as the collaterals.

The volatility of price can negatively affect the collateral which safeguards the solvency of the protocol and must cover the loan liabilities. The risk of the collateral falling below the loan amounts can be mitigated through the level of coverage required, the Loan-To-Value.

It also affects the liquidation process as the margin for liquidators needs to allow for profit.
The less volatile currencies are the stablecoins followed by ETH, they have the highest LTV at 75%, and the highest liquidation threshold at 80%.

The most volatile currencies REP and LEND have the lowest LTV at 35% and
40%. The liquidations thresholds are set at 65% to protect Aave users from a sharp drop in price which could lead to undercollaterisation followed by liquidation.

## Liquidation Threashold

$$
\text { Liquidation Threshold }=\frac{\sum \text { Collateral }_{i} \text { in } E T H \times \text { Liquidation } \text { Threshold }_{i}}{\text { Total Collateral in ETH }}
$$

## Health Factor

$$
H_{f}=\frac{\sum \text { Collateral }_{i} \text { in } E T H \times \text { Liquidation } \text { Threshold }_{i}}{\text { Total Borrows in } E T H+\text { Total Fees in } E T H}
$$

Market risks have the most direct impact on the risk parameters:

## Utilisaation Rate

$$
U=\text { TotalBorrows / TotalLiquidity }
$$

## Historical Utilisation Rate

Since inception, across the assets of the Aave Market, full utilisation was reached only 1% of days since inception.
The table below shows the Aave Market statistics on the maximum daily utilisation as at the 24th of November 2020.

Statistic $\%$ of time
$\begin{array}{ll}=100 \% & 1 \% \\ >95 \% & 2.8 \% \\ >90 \% & 4.6 \% \\ >80 \% & 11.4 \% \\ >50 \% & 26 \% \\ <25 \% & 52.6 \% \\ <10 \% & 38.5 \% \\ <5 \% & 28.7 \%\end{array}$

## Valuation Risk

â€‹Yearn is an ecosystem of financial products governed by the YFI token.
The smart platform offers different optimised strategies based on DeFi
primitives such as Aave, gaining immense traction and attracting nearly
a billion dollars of AUM in just over a month.

The governance token YFI is distributed to users who provide liquidity for the various products. The token holders discuss strategies and vote on policies in the governance forum while the technical side is led by Andrey Cronje.

YFI Smart contract Risk: B-

The YFI smart contract was deployed on the 17th of July yet it already holds more transactions and holders than some other assets of portfolio. The simple ERC20 implementation with permissions only to the governance contract controlled by the YFI holders leads to a reduced technical risk

YFI Counterparty Risk: B

YFI is fully decentralised, its distribution to Yearn liquidity
providers is among the fairest and most transparent. The community is
already strong of 6,000 holders.
YFI Market Risk: B-

It is incredible to see the market metrics reached by YFI in just over a
month. The monthly average 24h volume reaches nearly $700m. This has
been accompanied by some of the most extreme price volatility observed
even within the industry with the price surging from 50$ to 35,000\$
leading to a high volatility risk.
